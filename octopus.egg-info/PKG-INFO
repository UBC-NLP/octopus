Turjuman, a neural toolkit for translating from 20 languages into Modern
Standard Arabic (MSA) that described in our OSACT5 2022 paper "TURJUMAN:
A Public Toolkit for Neural Arabic Machine Translation".

TURJUMAN exploits the recently-introduced our text-to-text Transformer
`AraT5 model <https://github.com/UBC-NLP/araT5>`__ , endowing it with a powerful ability to decode into Arabic. The
toolkit offers the possibility of employing a number of diverse decoding
methods, making it suited for acquiring paraphrases for the MSA
translations as an added value. To train TURJUMAN, we sample from
publicly available parallel data employing a simple semantic similarity
method to ensure data quality.
